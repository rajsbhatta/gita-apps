  "sanskrit": "विभूतियोग",
  "verses": 42,
  "introduction": "Chapter 10 of the Bhagavad Gita, Vibhuti Yoga (The Yoga of Divine Opulences), is one of the most awe-inspiring and devotional chapters in the entire scripture. Having revealed His personal nature and the supremacy of devotion in Chapter 9, Krishna now responds to Arjuna’s request to describe His divine manifestations (vibhutis) — the most magnificent, glorious, and powerful expressions of Himself in the universe. This is Krishna’s loving answer to the devotee who longs to see and feel God everywhere. He lists dozens of His supreme opulences — the best, the first, the strongest, the most beautiful, the most essential in every category — so that Arjuna (and every reader) can train the mind to recognize the Divine presence in the grandeur of creation. For modern readers — living in a world of Instagram aesthetics, awe at nature documentaries, scientific wonder at the cosmos, and the search for meaning in everyday life — this chapter is a direct invitation: stop looking for God only in temples or meditation cushions; see Him in the majesty of mountains, the brilliance of the sun, the strength of leaders, the beauty of art, the intelligence of science, the love in relationships. The essence remains perfectly intact: Krishna is not distant — He is the source of all splendor, and by meditating on His opulences, the devotee’s heart becomes saturated with love, wonder, and constant remembrance of the Supreme Person.",

      "sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच |\nभूय एव महाबाहो शृणु मे परमं वचः |\nयत्तेऽहं प्रीयमाणाय वक्ष्यामि हितकाम्यया ||",
      "transliteration": "śrī-bhagavān uvāca\nbhūya eva mahā-bāho śṛṇu me paramaṁ vacaḥ\nyat te ’haṁ prīyamāṇāya vakṣyāmi hita-kāmyayā",
      "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, listen once more to My supreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit and which will give you great joy.",
      "modern": "Krishna begins with affection: 'Listen again, strong-armed one — I’m going to speak even more confidentially because I love you and want your highest good.' This is the tone of a friend who wants to share his deepest secrets. In 2026 life: most teachers repeat basics; Krishna says 'let me go deeper because you’re ready and because I care.' This verse sets the emotional climate — the coming revelations are given out of love, not obligation. For anyone who has ever felt spiritually stuck or unworthy, Krishna’s warmth here is medicine: the Divine wants to share more with you because you matter to Him."

      "transliteration": "na me viduḥ sura-gaṇāḥ prabhavaṁ na maharṣayaḥ\naham ādir hi devānāṁ maharṣīṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ",
      "translation": "Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin or opulences, for in every respect I am the source of the demigods and sages.",
      "modern": "Even the gods and great sages don’t fully know My origin or My divine glories — I am the source of them all. This establishes Krishna’s supremacy. In 2026 terms: the Divine is not a product of evolution, mythology, or human imagination — He is the origin of everything divine and wise. Even the highest beings in the cosmos don’t fully comprehend Him. This creates healthy awe: stop trying to fit God into your mental box — He is the box-maker. This verse humbles the intellect and opens the heart to wonder."

      "transliteration": "yo mām ajam anādiṁ ca vetti loka-maheśvaram\nasaṁmūḍhaḥ sa martyeṣu sarva-pāpaiḥ pramucyate",
      "translation": "He who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds — he is undeluded among men and is freed from all sinful reactions.",
      "modern": "Whoever knows Me as unborn, beginningless, and the supreme master of all worlds — that person is free from illusion and all sin. This is the liberating knowledge. In practice: recognize the Divine as eternal, without origin, and the ultimate authority over everything — this understanding alone cleanses karma and ends confusion. In 2026 life: most people see God as a concept, a force, or a historical figure. Krishna says: know Me as the timeless, causeless source — that realization is freedom. This verse is a direct pointer to non-dual yet personal truth — and it promises purification simply through correct knowing."

      "translation": "Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, control of the senses and mind, happiness and distress, birth, death, fear, fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame and infamy — all these various qualities of living beings are created by Me alone.",
      "modern": "Krishna lists dualities and qualities (intelligence, knowledge, confusion, forgiveness, truth, self-control, pleasure/pain, birth/death, fear/fearlessness, nonviolence, balance, contentment, austerity, charity, fame/infamy) — all come from Him. This is total sovereignty. In 2026: every positive and negative trait, every emotion, every state you experience — the Divine is the source. This ends blame and pride. You’re not the author of your virtues or vices — they are divine energies manifesting through you. Knowing this brings humility and detachment: 'All these are from You — I am just the instrument.' This verse turns psychology and self-improvement into devotion."

      "translation": "The seven great sages and before them the four other great sages and the Manus [progenitors of mankind] come from Me, born of My mind, and all the living beings descend from them.",
      "modern": "The seven rishis, the four Kumaras, the Manus — all born from My mind — and all beings descend from them. Krishna reveals Himself as the source of cosmic intelligence and human lineage. In practice: the great seers and progenitors are not independent — they are extensions of divine mind. This connects personal life to cosmic origin. In 2026: science traces human origins; Krishna traces them to divine consciousness. This verse inspires reverence for wisdom traditions and reminds us that intelligence itself is divine."

      "translation": "One who knows in truth this glory and power of Mine engages in unshakeable devotional service. Of this there is no doubt.",
      "modern": "Whoever truly understands My opulences and yogic power becomes fixed in unwavering devotion — no doubt. This is the result of vibhuti knowledge: unshakable bhakti. In practice: when you see the Divine’s greatness in creation, your love becomes steady. Krishna is saying: intellectual understanding of My majesty leads to heart-level devotion. This verse connects jnana and bhakti — knowing My glory makes love firm. In 2026: when awe at the universe or beauty of life turns your mind to the Source, devotion becomes natural and unbreakable. This is the fruit of the chapter."

      "modern": "(Repeated for emphasis in some editions.) Krishna reiterates: true knowledge of My opulences leads to steady yoga (union). This verse is a promise — understanding My greatness removes wobble from devotion. In daily life: when doubt or dryness comes, remember the divine manifestations — sun, moon, strength, beauty — and love returns. This is the stabilizer for the spiritual path."

      "modern": "I am the origin of everything — knowing this, the wise worship Me with full hearts. This is the turning point. In practice: when you realize 'everything comes from Him,' devotion becomes natural and wholehearted. The intelligent don’t just acknowledge — they respond with love. In 2026: science shows interconnectedness; Krishna says the source is personal and loving. Knowing this turns wonder into worship. This verse is the bridge from knowledge to bhakti — see the source and love the source."

In 2026: satsang — friends who share spiritual insights, discuss the Divine, inspire each other — brings deep fulfillment. Krishna is describing the joy of devotional friendship.

      "modern": "To those who serve Me constantly with love, I personally grant the intelligence that takes them to Me. This is divine grace in action. In practice: sincere loving service attracts divine insight. Krishna says: 'I give them the buddhi-yoga — the yoga of intelligence — to reach Me.' This is why devotees often have sudden clarity or intuitive guidance. The more you love and serve, the more the Divine illuminates your mind.

Krishna personally enters the devotee’s heart and lights the inner lamp. In 2026 life: when confusion, doubt, or darkness arises — sincere devotees receive inner clarity and illumination directly from the Divine. This verse explains sudden insights, breakthroughs, or 'aha' moments in spiritual life. The Divine is not external — He is the light within. This is the ultimate intimacy — God as your inner guru."
