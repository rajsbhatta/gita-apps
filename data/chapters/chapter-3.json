      "verse": 1,
      "sanskrit": "अर्जुन उवाच | ज्यायसी चेत्कर्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिर्जनार्दन | तत्किं कर्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि केशव ||",
      "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca | jyāyasī cet karmaṇas te matā buddhir janārdana | tat kiṁ karmaṇi ghore māṁ niyojayasi keśava",
      "translation": "Arjuna said: O Janardana, if You consider knowledge superior to action, why do You ask me to engage in this terrible action?",
      "modern": "Arjuna's basically saying 'Wait, if thinking/meditating is better, why are you telling me to fight?' It's like when someone tells you education is important but then says go work in construction. He's confused about mixed messages. We've all been there - getting contradictory advice and not knowing which path to take."

      "verse": 5,
      "sanskrit": "न हि कश्चित्क्षणमपि जातु तिष्ठत्यकर्मकृत् | कार्यते ह्यवशः कर्म सर्वः प्रकृतिजैर्गुणैः ||",
      "transliteration": "na hi kaścit kṣaṇam api jātu tiṣṭhaty akarma-kṛt | kāryate hy avaśaḥ karma sarvaḥ prakṛti-jair guṇaiḥ",
      "translation": "No one can remain without acting even for a moment. Everyone is forced to act by the qualities of material nature.",
      "modern": "You literally can't NOT do something. Even sitting there 'doing nothing' is an action - you're breathing, thinking, existing. Trying to avoid all action is impossible. It's like trying to not think about elephants when someone says 'don't think about elephants.' Your mind/body is always doing something. So the question isn't whether to act, but HOW to act."

      "verse": 8,
      "sanskrit": "नियतं कुरु कर्म त्वं कर्म ज्यायो ह्यकर्मणः | शरीरयात्रापि च ते न प्रसिद्ध्येदकर्मणः ||",
      "transliteration": "niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ | śarīra-yātrāpi ca te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ",
      "translation": "Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction. Even the maintenance of your body would not be possible without action.",
      "modern": "Do your job. Literally. Sitting around trying to 'find yourself' while avoiding responsibilities isn't enlightenment - it's just avoiding life. You need to eat, pay bills, maintain relationships. Even monks who meditate all day are 'acting' by meditating. The point is to engage with life, not check out. Those Instagram quotes about 'doing nothing' are cute but try paying rent that way."

      "verse": 9,
      "sanskrit": "यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः | तदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसङ्गः समाचर ||",
      "transliteration": "yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ | tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara",
      "translation": "Work done as a sacrifice for the Supreme Lord has to be performed. Otherwise work causes bondage in this material world.",
      "modern": "Here's the secret: work becomes a trap when you're doing it JUST for yourself - for money, status, validation. But when you do it as an offering, as service, it sets you free. It's the difference between cooking dinner because 'ugh I have to eat' vs cooking for someone you love. Same action, totally different energy. Do your work as a gift to the world, not as a transaction."

      "verse": 13,
      "sanskrit": "यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः | भुञ्जते ते त्वघं पापा ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात् ||",
      "transliteration": "yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ | bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpā ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt",
      "translation": "The spiritually-minded who eat food offered as sacrifice are freed from all sins. But those who cook food for their own enjoyment eat only sin.",
      "modern": "People who share what they have are at peace. People who hoard everything for themselves are miserable. It's that simple. Ever notice how the happiest people are those who give freely? And the most anxious people are those constantly accumulating and protecting their stuff? Generosity isn't just nice - it's psychologically liberating. Selfishness is its own punishment."

      "verse": 19,
      "sanskrit": "तस्मादसक्तः सततं कार्यं कर्म समाचर | असक्तो ह्याचरन्कर्म परमाप्नोति पूरुषः ||",
      "transliteration": "tasmād asaktaḥ satataṁ kāryaṁ karma samācara | asakto hy ācaran karma param āpnoti pūruṣaḥ",
      "translation": "Therefore, without attachment, perform always the work that has to be done, for working without attachment one attains the Supreme.",
      "modern": "Do your thing but don't be psycho about it. Show up, do great work, give your best - then let it go. Don't obsess over whether it got 100 likes or 1000. Don't check your email every 5 minutes to see if they replied. Do excellent work because excellent work is its own reward, not because you need external validation. That's how you actually achieve greatness - by being detached from needing it."

      "verse": 21,
      "sanskrit": "यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः | स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते ||",
      "transliteration": "yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ | sa yat pramāṇaṁ kurute lokas tad anuvartate",
      "translation": "Whatever action a great person performs, common people follow. Whatever standards they set, the world follows.",
      "modern": "Leaders set the culture. If your boss comes in late and half-asses everything, guess what the team does? If your parents are honest and hardworking, you probably are too. If influencers you follow are toxic, you'll absorb that energy. You become like the people you're around. So if you're in a leadership position - parent, manager, influencer, whatever - understand that people are watching and copying you, even when you don't realize it."

      "transliteration": "prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ | ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate",
      "translation": "The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.",
      "modern": "Your ego makes you think YOU did everything. 'I built this company!' Bro, you had a team, investors, customers, luck, timing, infrastructure, education. 'I'm a self-made millionaire!' Nobody is self-made. You used roads you didn't build, spoke a language you didn't invent, got opportunities from a system you were born into. Recognizing this isn't weakness - it's reality. Your ego wants credit for everything, but the universe is way bigger than you."

      "transliteration": "śreyān sva-dharmo viguṇaḥ para-dharmāt sv-anuṣṭhitāt | sva-dharme nidhanaṁ śreyaḥ para-dharmo bhayāvahaḥ",
      "translation": "It is better to engage in one's own occupation, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another's occupation and perform it perfectly.",
      "modern": "Be yourself, even if you're messy at it, rather than being a perfect copy of someone else. Trying to live someone else's life is exhausting and soul-crushing. You see someone successful and think 'I should do what they do,' but you're not them. Your path is yours. Better to be a mediocre original than a great imitation. Stop comparing your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 20. Run your own race."

      "transliteration": "arjuna uvāca | atha kena prayukto 'yaṁ pāpaṁ carati pūruṣaḥ | anicchan napi vārṣṇeya balād iva niyojitaḥ",
      "translation": "Arjuna asked: What forces one to sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if compelled by force?",
      "modern": "'Why do I keep doing things I know I shouldn't?' Arjuna's asking the eternal question we all ask. Why did I eat that? Why did I say that? Why did I go back to my ex? Why did I scroll for 3 hours? It's like there's a force making us self-sabotage. This is the question everyone in therapy is trying to answer."

      "translation": "The Supreme Lord said: It is lust and anger, born of passion, that compel one to sin. Know this as the enemy.",
      "modern": "Desire and anger are what mess you up. You WANT something (validation, pleasure, revenge, whatever) and when you don't get it, you get MAD. That combo of wanting + frustration = doing dumb stuff. It's why you drunk text your ex (desire), rage quit your job (anger), impulse buy things (desire), start fights online (anger). These two emotions hijack your brain and make you act against your own best interests. Recognize them as the enemy."

      "transliteration": "indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur indriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ | manasas tu parā buddhir yo buddheḥ paratas tu saḥ",
      "translation": "The senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and the soul is even higher than the intelligence.",
      "modern": "There's a hierarchy in you: Your body/senses are the lowest level (hungry, horny, tired). Your mind is above that (thoughts, emotions). Your intellect is above your mind (rational thinking, wisdom). And your true self is above all of that. When you let your body run the show, you're a slave to cravings. When you let your mind run things, you're ruled by emotions. But when your higher intellect is in charge? That's when you make good decisions. Most people are living at level 1 or 2. Level up."

      "transliteration": "evaṁ buddheḥ paraṁ buddhvā saṁstabhyātmānam ātmanā | jahi śatruṁ mahā-bāho kāma-rūpaṁ durāsadam",
      "translation": "Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to the material senses, mind and intelligence, one should steady the mind by deliberate spiritual intelligence and conquer this formidable enemy known as lust.",
      "modern": "Use your highest self to control your lowest self. When you're about to do something stupid driven by desire or anger, pause and engage your rational mind. 'Wait, do I actually want this or is it just my emotions talking?' Most of the time, it's emotions. Your wise self knows better than your impulsive self. The practice is catching yourself before you act on every craving. That's self-mastery. That's freedom."
