      "translation": "Foods which increase life, vitality, strength, health, happiness and satisfaction, which are juicy, fatty, wholesome, and pleasing to the heart, are dear to those in goodness.",
      "modern": "Eat real food that makes you feel good - not processed junk, not virtue-signaling restrictive diets. Foods that give you energy, make you healthy, and taste good. Your grandma knew this. Somehow we forgot and started eating chemicals. Just eat actual food. You know what's good for you. Trust your body, not Instagram wellness influencers."

      "translation": "Anything done without faith - whether sacrifice, charity, austerity or any other act - is useless in this life and the next.",
      "modern": "If you do stuff without believing in it, it's pointless. Going through the motions at work? Waste. Donating just for tax write-off? Empty. Exercising because you 'should' not because you value health? Won't last. Whatever you do, do it with conviction. Or don't do it at all. Half-assed effort with no heart behind it helps nobody, including you."
