      "sanskrit": "सहजं कर्म कौन्तेय सदोषमपि न त्यजेत् | सर्वारम्भा हि दोषेण धूमेनाग्निरिवावृताः ||",
      "transliteration": "saha-jaṁ karma kaunteya sa-doṣam api na tyajet | sarvārambhā hi doṣeṇa dhūmenāgnir ivāvṛtāḥ",
      "translation": "One should not give up work born of one's nature, even if it has faults. All endeavors are covered by some fault, as fire is covered by smoke.",
      "modern": "Don't quit your thing just because it's imperfect. Everything has flaws. Every job has downsides. Every relationship has issues. Every path has obstacles. That's life. Perfectionism is just an excuse to avoid commitment. Do your work despite the imperfections. The fire is still there under the smoke. Keep going."

      "modern": "This is the final word: Let go of everything you think you know, all your rules and should's and have-to's, and just surrender to what IS. Trust the process. Trust life. Trust the universe. Stop trying to control everything. You don't have to figure it all out. Just be open, be present, do your best, and let go. Everything will be okay. Stop worrying."

      "translation": "Wherever there is Krishna, the master of yoga, and Arjuna, the wielder of the bow, there will certainly be opulence, victory, power and morality.",
      "modern": "When you combine higher wisdom (Krishna) with disciplined action (Arjuna), success is inevitable. When your spiritual practice meets your real-world hustle, magic happens. You need both - the vision AND the execution. Meditation without action is escapism. Action without wisdom is exhausting. Put them together? You're unstoppable. That's the whole teaching right there."
