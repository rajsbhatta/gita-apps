      "sanskrit": "अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते | तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् ||",
      "transliteration": "ananyāś cintayanto māṁ ye janāḥ paryupāsate | teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham",
      "translation": "To those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on Me constantly, I preserve what they have and provide what they lack.",
      "modern": "When you're fully committed to your purpose, the universe conspires to help you. Not in a magical way, but because single-minded focus creates opportunities you'd otherwise miss. When you're 100% in, resources appear, people show up, doors open. It's not that you're lucky - it's that you're paying attention and ready. Commitment attracts support."

      "translation": "Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform - do that as an offering to Me.",
      "modern": "Make everything sacred. Cooking dinner? Do it with love. Going to work? See it as service. Even brushing your teeth can be an act of self-care and gratitude for your body. When you shift your perspective to see ordinary actions as meaningful, your whole life becomes spiritual practice. You don't need to be in a temple 24/7. You're always in the temple."
