      "sanskrit": "तस्मात्त्वमुत्तिष्ठ यशो लभस्व जित्वा शत्रून्भुङ्क्ष्व राज्यं समृद्धम् | मयैवैते निहताः पूर्वमेव निमित्तमात्रं भव सव्यसाचिन् ||",

      "translation": "Therefore arise and attain glory. Conquer your enemies and enjoy a prosperous kingdom. They are already slain by Me. Be merely an instrument.",
      "modern": "The outcome is already determined by forces bigger than you. Your job isn't to make everything happen - it's to show up and play your part. Stop carrying the weight of the world. You're not that powerful. Do your best, then surrender the results. You're an instrument, not the orchestrator. This takes so much pressure off."

      "translation": "One who does work for Me, who depends on Me, who is devoted to Me, free from attachment, without enmity toward any being - such a person comes to Me.",
      "modern": "The ideal: Do your work as service. Depend on something bigger than yourself. Be committed to growth. Don't get attached to outcomes. And don't hate anyone. That's the whole path right there. Simple but not easy. Most people fail at one or more of these. But if you can live this way, you're free."
