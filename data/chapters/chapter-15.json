      "translation": "The living entities in this world are My eternal parts. But bound by material nature, they struggle with the six senses, which include the mind.",
      "modern": "You're literally a piece of the divine, just caught up in the material world. Your senses (sight, sound, taste, touch, smell, plus mind) are constantly pulling you around like dogs on leashes. 'I need that.' 'I hate this.' 'I want more.' Your senses run your life unless you train them. Most people are slaves to their senses. Masters are rare."

      "transliteration": "yo mām evam asammūḍho jānāti puruṣottamam | sa sarva-vid bhajati māṁ sarva-bhāvena bhārata",
      "translation": "Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Person, without doubting, knows everything and engages in complete devotion to Me.",
      "modern": "When you truly get that there's something infinitely bigger than yourself, everything clicks. You stop thinking you're the center of the universe. You relax into being part of something vast and mysterious. This isn't about blind belief - it's about understanding your place in the cosmos. And paradoxically, that's when you actually become free."
