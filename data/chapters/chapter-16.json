      "translation": "There are three gates leading to self-destruction: lust, anger, and greed. Therefore, one should abandon these three.",
      "modern": "The trinity of self-sabotage: wanting what you don't have (lust), being mad when you don't get it (anger), and never having enough (greed). These three will absolutely wreck your life. Check any disaster in your life - guaranteed one of these three was driving. Addiction, bad relationships, financial ruin, whatever - trace it back and you'll find lust, anger, or greed. Avoid these like your life depends on it. Because it does."

      "modern": "You need a moral framework. Whether it's scripture, philosophy, or values you've developed - you need principles to guide you. Without them, you'll just do whatever feels good in the moment, which usually leads to disaster. Have a code. Live by it. Doesn't mean you're rigid or close-minded. It means you have standards. Everyone needs an operating system for life."
