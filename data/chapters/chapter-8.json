      "sanskrit": "अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम् | यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः ||",
      "transliteration": "anta-kāle ca mām eva smaran muktvā kalevaram | yaḥ prayāti sa mad-bhāvaṁ yāti nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ",
      "translation": "Whoever, at the time of death, quits their body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature.",
      "modern": "What you think about in your final moment matters. But really, this is about what you think about ALL the time. Because your last thought will be whatever dominated your life. If you lived for money, you'll die thinking about money. If you lived for love, you'll die thinking about love. Your death thought reveals your life's focus. So choose wisely what you obsess over now."

      "modern": "Stay connected to your higher purpose while handling your daily battles. Meditate AND take action. Pray AND do the work. Be spiritual AND practical. People think it's either/or, but it's both/and. You can be deeply spiritual while crushing it in the material world. In fact, that's the whole point - bring that elevated consciousness INTO your regular life."
